           Our country's restaurant industry has grown steadily over the past few years, and we believe that an application that gives consumers
           ideas on where to visit on their quest to have a spectacular dining experience would be beneficial to consumers and restauranteurs alike.

           <p>A group of qualified, highly-trained developers, devoted to ensuring that Jamaicans and visitors to the island never have a bad dining experience
           again, built a web application, the only one of its kind in Jamaica, to remove the hassle and uncertainty involved with discovering restaurants. 
           So say goodbye to the days of relying on word of mouth recommendations, browsing multiple web pages, scanning social media feeds and flipping through the
           Yellow Pages to find the perfect restaurant, and say hello to Tastebuds.
